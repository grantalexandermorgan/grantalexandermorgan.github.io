          <p>
            Literature Review on potential combined treatment for Social Phobia.
            Corroborated studies on comorbid GAD demonstrate pharmacologic
            and Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment could potentially prove more effective

          <p>
            Group research project on potential residential, environmental, and
            transportational conservation goals to alleviate the California Drought.
            Residential regulations in combination with other agricultural restrictions
             on wasteful practices, as well as a move toward electric freight could
              drastically reduce water usage in California.
